<li>Open-source: free to share, inspect, and change as you like.</li>
<li>Reasonable: sane defaults, no guesses about what you care about, doesn't ignore what <b>you</b> want.</li>
<li>End-to-end encrypted: the only people who can see your conversations are the people you're talking to.</li>
<li>Distributed: no central servers that can be taken down or compelled to turn over data.</li>
<li>Lightweight: no telemetry, ads, or other forms of monitoring.</li>
</ul>
